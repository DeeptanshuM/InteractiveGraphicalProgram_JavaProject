**Visualizing Geospatial Data**

I haven't used Java in a while so I am working on this project to relearn the language. The goal is to work on it a little bit each day until I am I satisfied with the end result.

I'll maintain a record here of the work done each day.
>Day 1: set up the starter files and started to become familiar with the unfoldingMaps package by creating and displaying a new map object centered on my town
